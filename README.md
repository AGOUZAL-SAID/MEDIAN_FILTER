# Median Filter for Gaussian Noise Removal

## Project Overview
This academic project, conducted during the second year of engineering studies at **Télécom Paris**, focuses on the **hardware implementation of a median filter** designed to remove Gaussian noise from digital signals. Developed entirely in **SystemVerilog**, the project emphasizes efficient digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and hardware-software co-design principles. The work was completed in collaboration with **Souhail AIT FORA**.
